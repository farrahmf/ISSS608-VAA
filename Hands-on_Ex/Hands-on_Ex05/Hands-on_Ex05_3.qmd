## Building Heatmaps

### Loading packages and importing data

```{r}
pacman::p_load(seriation, dendextend, heatmaply, tidyverse)
wh <- read_csv("data/WHData-2018.csv")
```

### Transforming the data frame to a data matrix

Replace the row names (currently just numbers) with their corresponding country names:

```{r}
row.names(wh) <- wh$Country
```

Transforming to a data matrix:

```{r}
wh1 <- dplyr::select(wh, c(3, 7:12))  ## what is this for?
wh_matrix <- data.matrix(wh)
wh_matrix1 <- data.matrix(wh1) ## added
```

Static heatmap with column value indicated by colour intensity:

```{r}
wh_heatmap <- heatmap(wh_matrix,
                      scale="column",
                      cexRow = 0.6, 
                      cexCol = 0.8,
                      margins = c(10, 4))
```
